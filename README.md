## Hi there 👋

Microsoft-Certified Azure DevOps Engineer  Cloud Automation Specialist  CI/CD Architect  Kubernetes Enthusiast
Hi, I’m Nishant Gawande, a DevOps Engineer with 3.5+ years of experience architecting secure, scalable, and automation-driven cloud infrastructure. I work closely with Microsoft’s Autopilot/Pilotfish platforms through Tata Consultancy Services, leading monthly security patch rollouts and compliance deployments across global environments.
🔧 I specialize in Azure, Azure DevOps, Kubernetes (AKS), and Terraform, with deep expertise in building cross-platform CI/CD pipelines that integrate security, quality, and deployment automation. My pipelines are designed to be resilient, developer-friendly, and production-grade—whether running on Windows agents or Dockerized Jenkins containers.

📈 My journey has evolved from embedded OS support to cloud-native DevOps leadership, with a focus on modularization, error-proofing, and platform independence. I thrive on solving real-world problems, sharing technical guides, and continuously refining infrastructure for reliability and scale.
